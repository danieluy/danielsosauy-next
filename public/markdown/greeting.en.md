The purpose of this site is to host whatever I feel like.

It may contain introductory information, resources I'd like to have on hand, and who knows what else; it will change and hopefully evolve over time.

For everything I do here I'll try to have the accessibility at the top of my mind, but I will also focus on design and performance.
