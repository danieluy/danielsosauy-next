The purpose of this site is to **present what I like to do**. It was created out of the necessity of displaying my work and my aptitudes, since they fall out of what my academic formation demonstrates.

Everything was made (or is going to be made), following these principles: accessibility, design, performance. The source code of this site is open source and it's freely available on Github under the MIT license. You can get it through my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/danieluy/danielsosauy).
